### The Goal 
Iceland has many tourists, but is a very difficult country to tour. Although most of the coutry speaks English, the weather patterns and cost of living make for a less than smooth experience. Logn is a wifi sign in page designed to educate tourists about the country they're visiting to help make their experience better. 

### The Approach 
The team conducted many interviews at the Keflavik Airport and spoke with people from Iceland's Ministry of Tourism and Iceland Air (owners of Keflavik). We found that there is a desire to educate tourists, an opportunity to create a wifi platform and add value for tourists of the airport. 

### The Result 
Without any party being able to make a profit, the project flopped. It's easy to say "just add ads", but much harder to do. In the short time-period of the project, we needed to be thinking about advertising money a lot earlier in order to make the adjustments needed to make this a profitable product.
